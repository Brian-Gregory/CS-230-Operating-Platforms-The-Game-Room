	Singleton Pattern Overview:

	The purpose of the singleton pattern is to ensure that only one instance of a particular class
	is created and used throughout the application's lifecycle. In this case, the singleton pattern 
	is applied by making the GameService constructor private. 

	To get the instance of GameService, you must call the public static method getInstance().
	This method checks whether the static gameService field has been initialized. If it hasnâ€™t,
	a new instance is created. If it has, the existing instance is returned, guaranteeing 
	a single instance during the program's execution.
